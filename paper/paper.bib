  abstract = {The signal change in fMRI is dependent on the echo time and the rate of decay of transverse magnetization. The latter factor may vary across regions of the brain as a result of variations in field homogeneity. Previous measurements of the signal change with echo time have generally employed relatively slow multi-echo techniques, which may be sensitive to movement and habituation effects. Here a fast T measurement technique, involving the generation of six low-resolution echo planar images from a single FID, is described, and its use in the evaluation of the optimum echo time for visual, motor, and auditory fMRI experiments at 3.0 T is outlined.

  abstract = {The study of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data has greatly benefitted from the development of sophisticated and efficient algorithms aimed at automating and optimizing the analysis of brain data. We address, in the context of the segmentation of brain from non-brain tissue (i.e., brain extraction, also known as skull-stripping), the tension between the increased theoretical and clinical interest in patient data, and the difficulty of conventional algorithms to function optimally in the presence of gross brain pathology. Indeed, because of the reliance of many algorithms on priors derived from healthy volunteers, images with gross pathology can severely affect their ability to correctly trace the boundaries between brain and non-brain tissue, potentially biasing subsequent analysis. We describe and make available an optimized brain extraction script for the pathological brain (optiBET) robust to the presence of pathology. Rather than attempting to trace the boundary between tissues, optiBET performs brain extraction by (i) calculating an initial approximate brain extraction; (ii) employing linear and non-linear registration to project the approximate extraction into the MNI template space; (iii) back-projecting a standard brain-only mask from template space to the subject’s original space; and (iv) employing the back-projected brain-only mask to mask-out non-brain tissue. The script results in up to 94\% improvement of the quality of extractions over those obtained with conventional software across a large set of severely pathological brains. Since optiBET makes use of freely available algorithms included in FSL, it should be readily employable by anyone having access to such tools.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in MRI receiver and coil technologies have significantly improved image signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and thus temporal SNR (TSNR). These gains in SNR and TSNR have allowed the detection of fMRI signal changes at higher spatial resolution and therefore have increased the potential to localize small brain structures such as cortical layers and columns. The majority of current fMRI processing strategies employ multi-subject averaging and therefore require spatial smoothing and normalization, effectively negating these gains in spatial resolution higher than about 10~mm3. Reliable detection of activation in single subjects at high resolution is becoming a more common desire among fMRI researchers who are interested in comparing individuals rather than populations. Since TSNR decreases with voxel volume, detection of activation at higher resolutions requires longer scan durations. The relationship between TSNR, voxel volume and detectability is highly non-linear. In this study, the relationship between TSNR and the necessary fMRI scan duration required to obtain significant results at varying P values is determined both experimentally and theoretically. The results demonstrate that, with a TSNR of 50, detection of activation of above 2\% requires at most 350 scan volumes (when steps are taken to remove the influence of physiological noise from the data). Importantly, these results also demonstrate that, for activation magnitude on the order of 1\%, the scan duration required is more sensitive to the TSNR level than at 2\%. This study showed that with voxel volumes of ∼10~mm3 at 3~T, and a corresponding TSNR of ∼50, the required number of time points that guarantees detection of signal changes of 1\% is about 860, but if TSNR increases by only 20\%, the time for detection decreases by more than 30\%. More than just being an exercise in numbers, these results imply that imaging of columnar resolution (effect size=1\% and assuming a TR of 1~s) at 3~T will require either 10~min for a TSNR of 60 or 40~min for a TSNR of 30. The implication is that at these resolutions, TSNR is likely to be critical for determining success or failure of an experiment.},

  abstract = {New theoretical and practical concepts are presented for considerably enhancing the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by means of arrays of multiple receiver coils. Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and ‐space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one‐half using a two‐coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double‐oblique heart images were obtained in one‐third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952–962, 1999. © 1999 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

Depending on how the signal of interest and the noise are identified, signal-to-noise ratio for fMRI data is reported by using many different definitions. Since each definition comes with a different scale, interpreting and comparing signal-to-noise ratio values for fMRI data can be a very challenging job. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing definitions. Further, the relationship with activation detection power is investigated. Reference tables and conversion formulae are provided to facilitate comparability between fMRI studies.},
