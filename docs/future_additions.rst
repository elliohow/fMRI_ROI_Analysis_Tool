.. note::
   Ideas given in no particular order. Any suggestions can be made on...

General
=======
* Test fRAT with empty parameters for cases where a single metric is set to be reported and not a comparison between multiple parameters
  - May need to find references to config.parameter_dict/cfg.parameter_dict to see how it is handled when blank
* Summarise data across an ROI (time series analysis)
* Add Pyinstaller support
* Add PyPi support
* Add support for custom statistical map functions
* Add option to only keep essential files when running statistical map functions (such as '_tSNR')
* Dash barchart code needs an overhaul as it isn't currently viable to easily add new features
    - Long names currently get cutoff
* (Potential) Add ability to analyse more than fMRI volumes (such as anatomical volumes)
* (Potential) Add easy way load analysis results data so jupyter notebook can be used to explore the data with graphs/statistics


GUI
===
* Separate fRAT into 3 components (main analysis, creation of statmaps such as tSNR, general fMRI tools)
* Ability to make saveable analysis profiles to quickly swap between settings

Analysis
========
* Add option to bootstrap confidence intervals
* Allow registration to more MNI templates
* Allow registration to custom templates and ROI atlases
* Add ability to skip running a file through analysis if file has already been ran through analysis
    - May be good for combining large datasets or adding new participants to the analysis
    - May only be possible with participant averaged data
    - Currently output folder is deleted when rerunning analysis due to mcf files
    - Need to find a way to deal with files which have now been set to ignore in paramValues.csv
    - Need to also force the analysis to rerun if parameter values have changed


Figures
=======
* 3d representation of the brain grid data
* Option to use scientific notation for brain figures: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/2220
* Ability to add manual lines to graphs (for example, to represent minimum usable tSNR)
* Improve customisation options of figures (for example, currently barcharts look too big if fewer parameters selected)
* Add option to add number of voxels to histogram plots
* Give one IV barcharts colour
* (Potential) Interactive plots

Statistics
==========
* Add ability to compare if linear mixed model coefficients significantly vary between regions

Bug fixes
=========
* figure_log is currently given a page when creating html pages
