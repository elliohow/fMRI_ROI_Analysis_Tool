## General settings
verbose = true                                                                    # true or false. Print progress to terminal.
multicore_processing = false                                                      # true or false. Use multicore processing during analysis? Multicore processing currently works within participants not between them. Recommended: true
max_core_usage = 'max'                                                            # 'max' to select number of cores available on the system, alternatively an int to manually select number of cores to use. Recommended: 'max' Options: ['max', 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1].
base_folder = ''                                                                  # Either the absolute location of the folder containing the subjects or blank, if blank then a browser window will allow you to search for the files at runtime.
input_folder_name = 'func'                                                        # Folder found in each subjects directory containing the files to be analysed.
output_folder_name = 'DEFAULT'                                                    # Directory to save output. If set to DEFAULT, the default name for the statistical map created will be used. Recommended: DEFAULT

## High pass filtering
temporal_filter = true                                                            # true or false. Use a high pass filter to remove low frequency drift. Recommended: true
highpass_filter_cutoff = 0.01                                                     # Highpass filter cutoff frequency converted into sigma in seconds using the formula 1/(2*f*TR). Recommended: 0.01

## Motion correction
remove_motion_outliers = true                                                     # true or false. Use fsl_motion_outliers to remove motion outliers(uses default fsl_motion_outliers settings). Recommended: true
motion_correction = true                                                          # true or false. Use MCFLIRT to motion correct volumes (uses default MCFLIRT settings). Recommended: true

## Spatial smoothing
spatial_smoothing = false                                                         # true or false. Uses SUSAN to spatial smooth. Recommended: true
smoothing_fwhm = 8.0                                                              # fwhm of smoothing, in mm, gets converted using sqrt(8*log(2)). Recommended: 8.0
smoothing_brightness_threshold = 2000.0                                           # Should be greater than noise level and less than contrast of edges to be preserved. Recommended: 2000.0

## Image SNR calculation
magnitude_correction = true                                                       # true or false. Correction factor of 0.7 applied when running iSNR calculations, to correct for Rayleigh distributed noise when using magnitude vs complex images.  Reference: Constantinides, C. D., Atalar, E., & McVeigh, E. R. (1997). Signal-to-Noise Measurements in Magnitude Images from NMR Phased Arrays.
noise_volume = false                                                              # true or false. Select true if a noise volume has been collected as part of the fMRI time series. NOTE: If true, the noise volume in the time series will be separated from the functional volumes and will be placed into the folder "func_noiseVolumeRemoved". If "noise volume" is true and "noise value" is not none, the noise volume will be used in image SNR calculation rather than the user defined noise value.
noise_volume_location = 'End'                                                     # 'max' to select number of cores available on the system, alternatively an int to manually select number of cores to use. Recommended: 'max' Options: ['Beginning', 'End'].
iSNR_std_use_only_nonzero_voxels = true                                           # true or false.

## Add Gaussian noise
noise_multipliers = [1]                                                           # Provide a comma-separated list of multipliers for the standard deviation of the gaussian noise to plot e.g. '1, 5'. NOTE: a separate file will be produced for each multiplier
